# Streaming Data from Client to Cloud Run Server withÂ HTTP/1

In this repo, we'll create a Cloud Run service using a Node.js server that logs incoming data chunks. 
We'll also create a Node.js client that sends chunks of data to the server.

If you would like to know more details on how it is done, please check my medium article on the link below

I hope you enjoyed!
